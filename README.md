# Winhance - Windows Enhancement Utility üöÄ

**Winhance** is a C# application designed to optimize and customize your Windows experience. From software management to system optimizations and customization, Winhance provides functions to enhance Windows 10 and 11 systems.

**Winhance** features most of the same enhancements as [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) without needing to do a clean install of Windows.

## Requirements üíª
- Windows 11
  - *Tested on Windows 11 24H2*
  - *Most things should work on Windows 10 22H2 but there are some issues like Microsoft Edge (legacy) removal*

## Installation üì•

- [ ] Improve Config Import to have checkboxes for sub sections in each category

### Software & Apps Screen

- [ ] Add an option to enable and Activate Windows Photo Viewer. Issue #135
- [‚úÖ] Fix the typo on the custom dialog box that incorrectly says "installd" and which should show "installed". Issue #146

#### Windows Apps & Features
- [ ] Add Icons next to the "Winhance Removal Status" that when clicked, deletes the scripts and scheduled tasks that are present when Winhance was previously run (ie. BloatRemoval.ps1, EdgeRemoval.ps1 and OneDriveRemoval.ps1)
- [ ] Rework EdgeRemoval script so it doesn't uninstall WebView. Also, update WebView installation
- [ ] Fix "We can't open this 'microsoft-edge' link" due to edge removal and no default browser found. Issue #38
- [‚åõ] WinHance Fails to Remove OneNote on Windows 11. This is due to OneNote no longer being an appx-package (like on Windows 10) and must be uninstalled using it's uninstaller. Issue #141

#### External Software
- [ ] For app installations, give users the option to choose a location to install the application. Issue #160
- [ ] Add a "website" icon next to each app in external software that will take the user to the specific app's webpage so users can get more info about the app before installing it. Issue #152
- [ ] Status Feature for External Software: Similar to Windows software, add a status feature for external applications to indicate whether they are installed. If installed, show if updates are available (updates indicator for windows softwares as well). Issue #142

Issue #135

### Optimize Screen

#### Windows Security Settings
- [‚åõ] Improve UAC slider to match all of the available options in Windows. User Account Control seems to be automatically set to "High" if a user has selected a value higher than that in Windows. This is due to Winhance not having all the available UAC options. Issue #166

#### Power Management
- [ ] Improve the power section to detect all power plans on the pc and add indicators next to each power plan in the dropdown menu showing what currently exists
- [ ] Improve the power section to have toggles that toggle the powercfg commands on the currently applied power plan (currently, importing the Ultimate Performance powerplan just automatically applies all "recommended" powercfg commands but there is no control over it) This will also fix #84

#### Gaming & Performance
- [ ] Review the "Mouse" related settings and why Enhance mouse precision won't work anymore due to mouse related tweaks in the gaming section. Issue #13

#### Windows Updates
- [‚úÖ] Change "Exclude Drivers from Windows Updates" toggle label to "Do not include drivers with Windows Updates" so it matches what Windows says in configured update policies. Issue #167
